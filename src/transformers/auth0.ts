/**
 * Transformer for migrating users from Auth0
 *
 * Maps Auth0's user export format to Clerk's import format.
 * Works with Auth0's Export Users API (https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Jobs/post_users_exports)
 *
 * Handles Auth0-specific features:
 * - user_id field (format: "provider|id", e.g., "auth0|abc123" or "github|12345")
 * - Email and phone verification status routing
 * - User and app metadata mapping
 * - Bcrypt password hashes (available via Auth0 support request)
 * - created_at timestamp conversion
 *
 * Note: Auth0 does not include password hashes in standard exports. You must contact
 * Auth0 support to request password hash export. Auth0 uses bcrypt ($2a$ or $2b$)
 * with 10 salt rounds.
 *
 * @property {string} key - Transformer identifier used in CLI
 * @property {string} label - Display name shown in CLI prompts
 * @property {string} description - Detailed description shown in CLI
 * @property {Object} transformer - Field mapping configuration
 * @property {Function} postTransform - Custom transformation logic for verification status
 * @property {Object} defaults - Default values applied to all users (passwordHasher: bcrypt)
