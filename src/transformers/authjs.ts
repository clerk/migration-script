 * Transformer for migrating users from Auth.js (formerly Next-Auth)
 *
 * Maps Auth.js user data to Clerk's import format.
 * This is a minimal transformer that only maps basic user fields.
 *
 * The postTransform function:
 * - Handles email verification status (routes to email or unverifiedEmailAddresses)
 * - Splits 'name' field into firstName (first word) and lastName (remaining words)
 *
 * @property {string} key - Transformer identifier used in CLI
 * @property {string} label - Display name shown in CLI prompts
 * @property {string} description - Detailed description shown in CLI
 * @property {Object} transformer - Field mapping configuration
 * @property {Function} postTransform - Handles email verification and name splitting
